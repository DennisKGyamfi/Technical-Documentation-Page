                JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for
                the
                development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for
                Client-side
                developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects,
                like;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Array</li>
                <li>Date</li>
                <li>Math</li>
                <li> and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </li>
            </ul>

                        <p>According to the Java platform official website, the main difference between Java and
                            JavaScript
                            is that Java is an OOP programming language while JavaScript is an OOP programming script.
                            JavaScript code is written completely in text and need only be interpreted. Java, on the
                            other
                            hand, must be compiled.
                        </p>
                        <p>They are also used for different types of projects. Java is used to make applications on
                            devices
                            or browsers, while JavaScript is used primarily on HTML documents and browsers. Different
                            plug-ins are used in order to use Java and JavaScript.

                            <p>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of
                                variables
                                in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.</p>
                            <p>There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as
                                <em>identifiers</em>).
                            </p>

                                <li>Name must start with a letter <code>(a to z or A to Z)</code>
                                    <code> underscore( _ )</code> or <code>dollar( $ ) sign.</code>

                                <li>After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1. </li>
                                <li>JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different
                                    variables.
                                </li>

                                    <p>Data types in JavaScript describe the different types or kinds of data that you

                                        be working with and storing in variables. It’s important that you learn each of
                                        these data types because otherwise data can get stored in an improper format
                                        which
                                        will result in issues in your code later on. </p>
                                    <p>Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that we’re gonna be
                                        working
                                        with and storing in variables.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most
                                        basic types of data are<em> strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and
                                            null.</em> We
                                        refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable can only store a
                                        single
                                        type of data. That means it’s important for you to learn to store the data
                                        correctly.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The computer is gonna identify what type of data you’re working with based off
                                        of
                                        the syntax, or the way that you write the code. It’s important that you remember
                                        and
                                        practice these differences, otherwise, data could get stored in an improper
                                        format
                                        and bite you later. </p>

                                        <p>A function is a group of statements that, together, perform a task. A

                                            declaration tells the JavaScript engine about a function’s name, return

                                            and parameters. When a function has been declared, it can be used anytime
                                            inside
                                            a class or development scope whenever it’s been called/invoked.

                                        <p> To declare a function, it must start with <code>function name()</code> just
                                            like
                                            a variable declaration must start with <code> Var.</code>
